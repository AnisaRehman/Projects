Snipy üîß,I'm literally only like 5 minutes in and this is making more sense then my weeks of classes. Sir you are amazing. You need to win some sort of award for the service you are doing for the millions of people watching. You are opening doors and potential futures for people. This could be life changing. You gained a subscriber.
Sam,My tiny brain can't comprehend how you crammed so much information into such a short timespan and still made it easily understandable. Thank you so much for this tutorial and I hope this will be the start of a coding passion for me.
Tatiana Alexandrovitch,"Excellent course! The concept is very clear and great presentation as well. I spent hours watching other courses and learned much less than I have learned with you in this short course. It is a ""crash course on steroids"" that teaches a lot of great information, and it is easy to follow. You have one more subscriber now. I am going to get your full course (for certification purposes). Thank you so much, Mosh!"
Anu GB,"Very very clear content and presentation. I have attended other 1 hour python courses and i was still confused on so many concepts, but this course is really good and gives no space for any such confusions. Thanks a lot. I would really sign up for an advanced course shortly as i am prepping for python certifications."
TheRacingRoo,This is exactly what I needed for my college course work. Learned C++ but a year later need to know python for a project. This helps so much and goes quick enough so I‚Äôm not bored but also slow enough that I can try it out myself. Thanks so much!
Dalia Ibrahim,"I really learned a lot from this video. Your voice, organization and one step at a time approach have encouraged me to learn more and more. I didn't feel tense at all. On the contrary, I felt it went smoothly and easily. Thank you so much."
F1 meme lord,"I am taking GCSE computer science and one of the main tips i got was to learn to code. Watching this one hour tutorial, I have learned more in two hours than I did in 5 lessons of python tutoring at school. Thanks mosh."

Lanre Odusina,"Wonderful work done here sir. Well explained and easy to understand... Showing us the errors and how to rectify them is just superb it gives us a better understanding rather. 
Is this coding for creating website or applications?"
Ubong,"As a programming newbie, I can say that this has simplified Python to a point that I am wholly interested. Awesome job, Mosh!!"
Beamer B,"Learning for the data science realm. I watched your SQL course and it was amazing. Thank you for being so clear and concise with your explanations. Most YouTube instructors, or instructors in general, don‚Äôt share the ‚Äúwhy you shouldn‚Äôt do something a certain way,‚Äù but you do. I feel job ready after watching your videos. Thank you for being awesome."
ice,"Hi Mosh, thank you so much for this video!
 i was curious about python and I'm super interested when I learned that it was so useful in many fields, especially now in my chosen degree. I actually watched this video so that I could have a bit of knowledge in the future since python is quite used in many areas and also in some job positions that I'm aiming in the future after I graduate. Thanks for making this, you've certainly helped a lot of people including me  <3"

HOC Fashions,"Thanks Mosh for this amazing material.Ô∏è

Please I have a question, why do we have to use  unit.upper in your solution for the third exercise?"
Paul Aulridge Jr,"Now THIS is superlative instruction; teach a concept, and then demonstrate it. That you include errors is a stroke of genius! The nuances of programming languages can be difficult to understand at first, but by showing things going WRONG, you also show how to CORRECT the mistakes. This is just brilliant work. Thank you! Subscribed as hell!"

Petri Lautam√§ki,3 minutes in and I'm already really appreciating the fact that you have taken into consideration that not everyone uses Mac and some uses Windows. It's a simple thing but so often forgotten.
Hal Harrison,"Also, for newcomers: I found it helpful to reduce playback speed to .75 in settings, and turn on CC.  The material goes fast, and this trick made it much easier to absorb the material."

I am still in the middle of the course but I can say that this channel is the #1 channel for those who want to learn to code! Keep it up!!
Juanita Jewett,"You have made me so happy I could cry, I am retaking a class that involves learning Python. I struggled so bad in that class. failing this class put me on academic probation because we have to maintain a 3.0 or higher.  YOU MADE This super Easy. I know I am going to pass this class for sure this time. You even showed how to look for what you did wrong that is so fantastic. I am Subscriber for Life Sir."

RiceDork,"This is amazing! So far I'm on the Weight converter exercise and I noticed a difference between ours which I can assume to either be an ""I'm sure you guys are smart enough to figure out something new for yourselves/I'm sure these guys will be excited to figure something out"" or simply an oversight (which happens). I realized you used else rather than elif resulting in an ""if not K, anything other letter"" will work situation. Here's mine:"
Sufyan,i just need to catch up my first year of computer science in highschool

P.S I think it's more straight forward than JS"
social loner,"started learning python with mosh through his YouTube tutorials. I watched the one which is over 6 hours and the other one which is 2 hours.
Mosh explains everything crystal clear. I really had no prior knowledge in programming and this whole programming world or whatsoever. And it seemed very daunting to me. But I gotta say thanks to mosh I started believing that I might be able to actually make it in the programming world."

Mr H - Travelling Teacher,"Mosh, please can you reveal the code for excercise 1. What is the output meant to look like?"
Stephen Wilkinson,"MOSH!, you legend. I've been umming and ahhing over 'learning to code' for years. Prior to this video my coding knowledge could be described as zero. You really set the basic concepts out in an easy to follow way and being able to pause, go back, take notes etc made this format perfect for me to learn my way (I have Asperger's Syndrome and probable ADHD). I'm now familiar with the basic concepts of Python and I'm excited to start coding and playing around before I follow another tutorial of yours. I'm planning to purchase your 12hr Python mastery course if the offer is still at the reduced price in a few days after I get paid. Can't wait to learn more Python with Mosh. Thanks man!."

Christopher Ferrer,Yeah he's a really good teacher to show you the difference in the uppercase and lowercase is definitely a definitive concept and important even the spacing sometimes it's difficult to see the spacing
Wensleydale,"This hour-long course was a great refresher for when you've stepped away for a while and need to get back up to speed. Awesome job. Quick, concise, easily understood."
Amandeep S,"Thank you Mosh!!!
I just started with this today.  It's been great and your lectures are helping a lot.

xal.,"Hi! Thanks for the video! First time trying to learn Python after learning css and html. 

On the first exercise, I googled how to write a conditional statement to output whether he was a new patient or not. I know it only works in this case. Just trying to get use to utilizing different statements and actually getting them to work, lol."

Doonkey Korng,"I wanna learn this for two main reasons:

1.) I‚Äôm just simply fascinated by computer science and programming, and realize how great of a skill they are to know in modern times. And I‚Äôve been told many times that Python is generally considered the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù and ‚Äúwidely used‚Äù language."

farlaff,"Hi, Mosh. First, thanks for making these amazing videos. I started going through them about three days ago and already spent about ten hours going back and forth the exercises. I actually regret not having started with this earlier. I have interest in Machine Learning, but that is for the future. For now, I would like to know if I could apply Python for editing E-Books that are going to be published in Kindle, for instance. Many of the formatting in the editions are repetitive and it seems there would be a possibility. If there is, I would like to know more about it. Cheers and all the best."
Adenso,"17:53 i really liked this calculator and i decided to make it a bit pretty as i was doing mine. obviously i had to watch til this point to figure out why i couldnt just simply concatenate the lines of code, but after learning why and fixing it i got here and i like the way it looks"
