Kilovolt,"After 2.5 years, I am returning here to say that I’ve just accepted a job offer for a good salary, and my IT journey started here, from this video, in November of 2019. This was my first source of information, when I got back from work (being a cable tech), and typed “Python full course” or something along those lines."
Dexcelo,"Can we just take a moment to appreciate this guy for providing this type of content for free ? great help, Thank you sir!"

SphinyAl,"I'm gonna add myself to the many ""thank you""s! I'm one hour in and I already understood more than I did in a TWO DAYS course I got from work. You singlehandedly gave me the trust that even I can learn python and programming. This video is worth gold to me right now! Thank you Mosh!"
Andrea Nava,"I am going to say, I have just 3 years as a English speaker (my first language is Spanish) and I understand EVERYTHING that you explain.

Oscar’s Life Miles,"Hats off ! Mosh I have no words to let you know how grateful I am for this free course, it is not only well designed but also easy to follow, God bless you. I am trying to transition and Python seems like a very good option and you already convinced me that I gotta keep on studying it. Thanks a lot"

I’m wanting to learn python because I’m a teacher with an IT background who wants to find a way to make simple web applications to make life easier for my fellow teachers. I’m mostly interested in creating a way for teachers to enter data (assessment data, house points etc), which can then be collated, summarised and displayed in useful ways."

Peter Johnson,"I am 82 years old, retired - obviously. I started work as a computer operator in 1968 and then moved on to (Cobol) programming. Those were the days! Quite often we would punch our own programs into 80 column punch cards because the girls(!) were busy doing (the more important!!) production work.
I'm really enjoying this Python tutorial course of yours and - so far - finding it quite straightforward with no probs. I'm just doing it for fun."

Basically, I am a wet lab scientist but really want to python to write different codes that will help me analyze the huge dataset. When I started working with large datasets I did all the calculations and sorted the data manually which is so labor intensive. Therefore, python will certainly help me in minimizing my efforts and provide more robust data analysis power."
Budapest,"Mosh you're a legend, I've been trying to study my python notes and I was learning very slow, your tutorial has helped me a lot in deep understanding of this concepts and quick learning. GOD bless you"
Vikash Kumar,Hi Mosh! A big thank you from India. I am an engineer in material science from last 6 years and never learnt any programming language to be frank and today I am starting my Python journey in a quest to enter in to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence for simulation of advanced materials. You have made this course super easy for the zero beginners like me. Hopefully I will complete this course and then will proceed to Python mastery course. And happy teacher's day (5th Sep is celebrated as teacher's day here in India).

Stefan B,"The ""elif"" is interesting. I can use ""if"" for both conditions, but if I set  both cold and hot to True, then both statements will print. In the case of ""elif"", only the first statement will be examined (only the ""if"", the ""elif"" will be skipped). Therefore it's really important which is the first IF condition (and also therefore important you have a good configuration)."
Alvin Crown,"As a retired developer of 42 years, I want to congratulate you on creating this course. You not only have mastered Python but what is rare, you are an excellent instructor. Thank you very much."

Divine love stories,"You explain so beautifully, it is fun to learn!"
aias aiascon,"I am also going to watch and follow this course Mosh! Like the MySQL, I feel already cool - using Python. I once begun with a book (a well known) but due to circumstances I got stuck in the middle of the book. I believe this is going to end so well. Mostly I need Python for data processing, reporting, and analysis in combination to Excel , not that much for designing Websites, but I will follow everything."
Tiandi,"(VERY IMPORTANT TIP FOR PEOPLE WATCHING!)
   Do not try watching the entire video at once. Limit your watch time from 30 or 60 minutes each day and make sure to participate and understand the code. This will take around a week to complete, but it will save you from feeling like you're not good enough. Don't rush yourself. Limit and pay attention!"
Lauren Fabian,"Last year2021, I was curious about websites that have the % character  and 1months ago(August 2022), I learned that Django involves the use of the % character to integrate html elements with python.
